“It’s possible to imagine a break with Russia that would endanger the space station,
but that would be at the level of a dropping diplomatic relations,” said Pace. 
“That would be something that would be an utterly last resort so I don’t really
see that happening unless there is a wider military confrontation.” The space station, 
an international partnership of five space agencies from 15 countries, including Canada,
several countries in Europe, Japan, Russia and the United States, launched in 1998 and
morphed into a complex that’s almost as long as a football field, with 13km of electrical 
wiring, an acre of solar panels and three high-tech labs.
